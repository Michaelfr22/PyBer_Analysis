# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the PyBer Analysis is to build a deeper understanding of the Ride-Sharing data found in the CSV files. Within the data provided is unorganized information revolving around three main _City Types_ (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) and how they differ based on multiple variables, such as Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver. The Python code attached in this repository combines the CSV files into a single dataframe, then calculates the totals for the variables listed previously. These totals are structured into a unique summary dataframe so that the three City Types can be easily compared. The code concludes by generating a _Multiple Line Graph_ that displays the trends of the Total Fare (USD$) for each of the three City Types over a period of four months in 2019.

## Results

In the summary dataframe, the five focal variables are contrasted for the three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Urban settings accounts for over half of the **Total Rides**, **Total Drivers**, and **Total Fares** for the three types. However, Rural and Suburban settings average a higher **Fare per Ride** and **Fare per Driver**, with Rural settings leading the three types in these two categories.

In regards to the Multiple Line Graph, key trends are identified for each of the three types listed below:

### Urban

Total Fares in Urban settings _peaked around the fourth week of February_ and the second week of March.
The lowest Total Fare in Urban settings was at the start of 2019 in January.
Overall _positive_ trend from January through March. Steady from March through April.

### Suburban

Total Fares in Suburban settings _ALSO peaked around the fourth week of February_.
The lowest points in Total Fare in Suburban settings were _at the start of January_, March, and the second week of April.
Overall _slight positive_ trend from January through March. Positive increase from March through April.

### Rural

Total Fares in Rural Settings _ALSO peaked around the fourth week of Fabruary_, then reached a secondary peak at the start of April.
The lowest points in Total Fare in Rural settings were during the second week of February.
Overall steady from January through April (all four months). Positive increase through the month of March.

## Summary: Three Business Recommendations

1. Increase marketing methods during the first half of February to prepare for the peak in Fare prices across all three city types.
2. Over 66% of marketing methods should target the Urban market.
3. Pay Drivers a larger % of the Ride Fare in the three types accordingly: Rural > Suburban > Urban.
   This will encourage more people to drive PyBer in Rural and Suburban settings, where the average Fare per Driver is higher (AKA more reward per drive).
